# VIPr
Using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) as a specific python library for text classification, paired with Web Scraping, VIPr functions through machine learning processes. By training, testing,  and validating the chosen dataset, and scraping for images, machine learning takes place. Not to mention the availability of datasets,  different sources of treebanks exist for different needs in language, words, or even sentences.      Directing VIPr as an assistive system, the goal stays centered in providing visual aids for presentations, image retrieval is necessary. With that, NLTK processes like Parts-of-speech tagger (POS tagger) takes place before web scraping specifically Imgur platform; as the tagged words becomes the basis on what gets to be scraped from Imgur.
